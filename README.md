# Number-guessing-Game-in-Java

Created a number guessing game in Java. Utilized JOptionPane packages for both system input and output. 

- **Description:**
  - This Java program implements a simple number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

- **Game Mechanics:**
  - The program generates a random number between 1 and 10 (inclusive) using the `Random` class.
  - The user is prompted to input the number of tries they want to take.
  - For each try, the user inputs a guess, and the program provides feedback on whether the guess is correct.

- **User Input:**
  - Utilizes `JOptionPane` for user-friendly input and output through dialog boxes.

- **Feedback System:**
  - Provides feedback messages indicating whether the guessed number is correct or wrong, along with the try number.

- **Game Outcome:**
  - If the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of tries taken and the correct guess.
  - If the user exhausts the allowed tries without a correct guess, a "GAME OVER" message is shown.

- **GitHub Integration:**
  - Suitable for version control using Git and hosting on GitHub.
  - Can be easily cloned and run by others interested in the number guessing game.

- **How to Run:**
  - Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Compile and run the Java program.
  - Follow the prompts to input the number of tries and make guesses.
